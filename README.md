# Global Illumination using Pix2Pix
 
## How to Run
You will need to ensure that you have a saved_models folder which is empty. As the network trains it will save to this folder.  A GenOutput folder is also needed for images that will be generated during training.

You can run the Train.py to train the network.

RunModel.py will load in a saved model and run the model on test images and generate a set of metrics.
